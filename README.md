This Python script is designed to make life easier by helping you and your parents stay on track with essential daily tasks. It automates reminders for taking medications at the right times throughout the day, like your eyedrops at 8 AM and pills after lunch and dinner. With notifications popping up right on your screen, you’ll have simple options—either mark it as "OK" to let it disappear, or ask to "Remind Later" if you need a nudge in two minutes. This ensures that crucial tasks won’t slip through the cracks, adding peace of mind and structure to your busy day.
